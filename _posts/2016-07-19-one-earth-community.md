# One Earth Community

In this day where the planet Earth is said to have "shrunk" due to technology.

Has humanity adapted to the convergence of different cultures ?

Has humanity matured at the same rate of the growth of technology ?

_**One Earth Community **_will explore the many wonders of our world.

_**One Earth Challenged **_will present a whole different perspective on humanity.

### Community and Family are the basis of our mission. Join Us.
